If youâ€™re reading this, Iâ€™m probably six Coke Zeros deep.

Iâ€™m a Windows guy by day and a macOS and iOS tinkerer by night. I specialize in Microsoft Entra, Intune, and Azure, building secure, scalable systems that keep organizations running smoothly while putting users at the center of every decision.

I grew up on a family farm in a one-stoplight town where we got three TV channels through an old antennaâ€”on a good day. That small-town grit and curiosity still drive me. Iâ€™m a lifelong learner always looking for smarter, more efficient ways to solve real-world IT challenges.

Whether Iâ€™m streamlining device deployment with Autopilot, tightening identity controls in Entra ID, or building automation in Azure, I focus on making complex systems simple, secure, and effective.

At the heart of it all are my wife Courtney and our daughter Aubrey. Theyâ€™re my reason, my perspective, and the motivation behind everything I do.
