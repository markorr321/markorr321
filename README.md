If you’re reading this, I’m probably six Coke Zeros deep.

I’m a Windows guy by day and a macOS and iOS tinkerer by night. I specialize in Microsoft Entra, Intune, and Azure, building secure, scalable systems that keep organizations running smoothly while putting users at the center of every decision.

I grew up on a family farm in a one-stoplight town where we got three TV channels through an old antenna—on a good day. That small-town grit and curiosity still drive me. I’m a lifelong learner always looking for smarter, more efficient ways to solve real-world IT challenges.

Whether I’m streamlining device deployment with Autopilot, tightening identity controls in Entra ID, or building automation in Azure, I focus on making complex systems simple, secure, and effective.

At the heart of it all are my wife Courtney and our daughter Aubrey. They’re my reason, my perspective, and the motivation behind everything I do.
